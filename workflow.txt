Here’s a recommended order for linking your pages and data with Firebase, based on your workflow:

Authentication First

Link signup.html and login.html to Firebase Auth.
Ensure users can register, log in, and their session is tracked.
Profile & Payment

After signup, direct users to a profile or payment page.
Integrate payment (external service) and store payment status in Firestore.
Submission

Once payment is confirmed, allow access to submit.html.
Use Firebase Storage for file uploads and Firestore for submission metadata.
User Dashboard

On dashboard.html, fetch user’s submissions, payment status, and review progress from Firestore.
Admin Pages

Link admin pages (admin-dashboard.html, admin-settings.html, admin-announcements.html) to Firestore for managing rounds, announcements, and user data.
Judges Pages

Judges log in via judges-login.html.
On judges-dashboard.html and judges-pending.html, fetch submissions from Firestore, allow rating, advancing, or disqualifying.
Announcements & Notifications

Store announcements in Firestore.
Display them on relevant pages (dashboard, public, etc.).
Public Voting

After judges select finalists, display them on a public page.
Allow public voting, store votes in Firestore.
Category Organization

Store all submissions and rounds with a category field in Firestore.
Filter and display data by category on all relevant pages.
Summary of Linking:

Start with authentication.
Gate access to submission and dashboard by payment status.
Use Firestore and Storage for all data (submissions, reviews, rounds, announcements, votes).
Organize everything by category for easy filtering.
